A lightweight wrapper to simplify Javascript camera capture :)

Provides browser agnostic shortcuts to get &lt;img&gt; and &lt;video&gt; DOM elements from a webcam.
Also provides a Capture class for rapid successive still captures as data URLs, &lt;img&gt; DOM elements, or drawn onto a 2d canvas context.

Currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and Opera
