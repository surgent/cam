cam.js
===

A lightweight wrapper to simplify javascript camera capture :)

Provides browser agnostic shortcuts to get <img> and <video> DOM elements from a webcam.
Also provides a Capture class for rapid successive still captures as data URLs, <img> DOM elements, or drawn onto a 2d canvas context.
